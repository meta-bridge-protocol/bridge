MetaBridge is an interchain abstraction layer with a customizable security stack that enables projects to launch multichain tokens or make their existing tokens multichain.

  Follow the instructions below:
### 1. Deploy tokens 
  Deploy both the native token and the MB token on each chain you intend to support.

### 2. Deploy Gateway
  Deploy the gateway contract to enable seamless swapping between the native token and the MB token.

### 3. Deploy Escrow
  Escrow is where manages gateway liquidity through a predefined threshold amount.
